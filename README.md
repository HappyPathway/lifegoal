- Adapts to your personal concerns and goals over time
- Intelligently reminds you of wellness tasks (eating, exercise, rest)
- Integrates with your calendar and email to help structure your day
- Self-extends through an AI plugin architecture based on your needs

## Key Features

- **Random Check-ins**: Sends timely wellness prompts and questions
- **Natural Language Processing**: Analyzes responses to extract structured wellbeing data
- **Auto-Configuring Concerns**: Automatically identifies wellbeing areas to track based on your responses
- **Intelligent Reminders**: Provides timely alerts based on your habits, goals, and check-in data
- **Goal Tracking**: Records habits, moods, and progress toward wellbeing goals
- **Insight Generation**: Creates summaries and suggests improvements based on trends
- **Calendar & Email Integration**: Structures your day around wellbeing goals
- **Dynamic Plugin Architecture**: Self-extends functionality through AI-generated code

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Monorepo Structure**
  - Modular organization for clean development and deployment
  - Clear separation of concerns for future scaling

- **Serverless Backend**
  - Google Cloud Functions for realtime interactions
  - GitHub Actions for scheduled tasks

- **Storage & State**
  - SQLite database in versioned GCS bucket
  - Structured data for wellness metrics and interactions

- **Plugin System**
  - Self-extending Python modules generated by AI
  - Versioning and management in repository
  - Plugin-to-goal mapping

- **AI Processing**
  - Dynamic LLM selection based on task requirements
  - NLP for extracting wellbeing data from natural language

### Interaction Channels
